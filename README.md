# Cryptocurrency Clustering Project

## Overview

This project focuses on clustering various cryptocurrencies based on their market and price data. By utilizing dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and clustering algorithms like K-Means, we aim to identify distinct groups within the cryptocurrency market.

## Objectives

- To analyze the relationships and differences between various cryptocurrencies.
- To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA.
- To apply K-Means clustering to categorize cryptocurrencies into distinct groups.
- To visualize the results and interpret the significance of each cluster.


## Key Steps


1. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
    - Applying PCA to reduce the dataset to principal components that capture the majority of the variance.

2. **Clustering**:
    - Using the K-Means algorithm to identify clusters within the dataset.
    - Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

3. **Visualization**:
    - Plotting the PCA-transformed data to visualize the clusters.
    - Using scatter plots and color-coding to differentiate between clusters.

## Results

- The analysis identified distinct clusters within the cryptocurrency market, with certain groups of cryptocurrencies showing clear separation from others.
- The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring that the clustering model was both accurate and efficient.
- PCA visualization provided a clearer understanding of the relationships between different cryptocurrencies.
